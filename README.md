## Description
- This application allows users to register and open bank accounts just like your normal online bank would.
  
- My motivation for this project was to learn how to manage a database with different accounts, userID's, and admin roles. I also wanted to test myself by creating functions to help me along the way
  
- I built this project because I worked in a bank once as a teller. Remembering that experience inspired me to create an application that did exactly what I would do as a teller.
  
- This application is very simple and user-friendly. Anyone who is not fond of online banking can easily open a new account and manage it as they please even if they are not tech savvy.
